If you have any question about setting up and modify the smart-contract, pls e-mail me. I will try my best to address the problem.

For convenience and efficiency in reproducing the algorithm and testing its effects, you can refer to the Python version. We have placed the code for the MaxPTE algorithm and the MaxNI algorithm in two separate folders for your reference and testing.
