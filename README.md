# Structural-Power ICDE2025
We conducted balance deficit experiments on the Lightning Network Daemon. If you're interested, you can download and install LND from the following link:
https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd

For your convenience in reproduction, you can also check the Python code in the MaxPTE algorithm and MaxNI algorithm folders, which contain the algorithm code and comparison experiments. The results are consistent with the statistical data tested in LND.
Other codes will coming soon...
